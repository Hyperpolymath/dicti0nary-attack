   - Examples if applicable

### Pull Requests

We love pull requests! Here's the process:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

4. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest

   # Check coverage
   pytest --cov=dicti0nary_attack

   # Run linters
   flake8 src/ tests/
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description
   - Reference any related issues

   - Include screenshots if applicable

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dicti0nary-attack.git
cd dicti0nary-attack

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 black isort

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line Length**: 127 characters max (relaxed from 79)
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for automatic formatting
- **Imports**: Use `isort` to organize imports
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings

Format your code:

```bash
# Auto-format with black
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Check with flake8
flake8 src/ tests/
```

## Testing Guidelines

All new features must include tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage

Test file structure:

```python
"""Tests for module_name."""

import pytest
from dicti0nary_attack.module import ClassName


class TestClassName:
    """Tests for ClassName."""

    def test_feature_description(self):
        """Test that feature works correctly."""
        # Arrange
        instance = ClassName()

        # Act
        result = instance.method()

        # Assert
        assert result == expected_value
```

## Documentation

Update documentation for:

- New features
- API changes
- Configuration options
- Usage examples

Documentation locations:
- `README.md` - Overview and quick start
- `docs/USAGE.md` - Detailed usage guide
- `docs/API.md` - API reference
- Code docstrings - Inline documentation

## Adding New Generators

To add a new password generator:

1. **Create generator file**: `src/dicti0nary_attack/generators/your_generator.py`

```python
from dicti0nary_attack.generators.base import PasswordGenerator
from typing import Iterator, Optional

class YourGenerator(PasswordGenerator):
    def generate(self, count: Optional[int] = None) -> Iterator[str]:
        # Your implementation
        pass
```

2. **Add to __init__.py**: `src/dicti0nary_attack/generators/__init__.py`

3. **Write tests**: `tests/test_your_generator.py`

4. **Update CLI**: Add to `src/dicti0nary_attack/cli.py`

5. **Update documentation**

## Adding New Features

For substantial features:

1. **Discuss first**: Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. **Plan the implementation**: Outline your approach
3. **Break into commits**: Make logical, atomic commits
4. **Test thoroughly**: Include comprehensive tests
5. **Document completely**: Update all relevant docs

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add feature: brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.
Include any relevant context or breaking changes.

Closes #123
```

Format:
- **Add**: New features
- **Fix**: Bug fixes
- **Update**: Changes to existing features
- **Refactor**: Code improvements without functional changes
- **Docs**: Documentation updates
- **Test**: Test additions or changes

## Review Process

All pull requests go through review:

1. Automated tests must pass
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Discussion and potential revisions
4. Approval and merge

## Security Considerations

When contributing:

- **Never commit secrets**: No API keys, passwords, etc.
- **Validate inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user input
