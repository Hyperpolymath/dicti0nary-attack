== Verification

To verify RSR compliance:

[source,bash]
----
# Check documentation
ls -la {README,LICENSE,CONTRIBUTING,CODE_OF_CONDUCT,SECURITY,CHANGELOG,MAINTAINERS}.md

# Check .well-known
ls -la .well-known/

# Run tests
pytest

# Check offline functionality
# (Disconnect from internet and run)
python -c "from dicti0nary_attack import LeetspeakGenerator; print(list(LeetspeakGenerator().generate(count=10)))"

# Verify no network calls in core
grep -r "requests\|urllib\|http" src/dicti0nary_attack/{generators,crackers}/
# Should return no results

# Check CI/CD
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Verify Docker builds
docker build -t dicti0nary-attack .
