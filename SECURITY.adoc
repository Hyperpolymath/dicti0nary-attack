= Security Policy

== Supported Versions

We take security seriously. The following versions are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

== Security Context

_dicti0nary-attack_ is a security research tool designed for:
- ✅ Authorized penetration testing
- ✅ Security audits of owned systems
- ✅ CTF competitions
- ✅ Academic research
- ✅ Password strength analysis

_Unauthorized use is illegal._ This tool must only be used with explicit written permission.

== Reporting a Vulnerability

=== Where to Report

_DO NOT_ open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report security issues via:

1. _Email_: security@[project-domain] (if available)
2. _GitHub Security Advisories_: Use the "Security" tab → "Report a vulnerability"
3. _Encrypted communication_: PGP key available in `.well-known/security.txt`

=== What to Include

Please include:

- _Description_: Clear description of the vulnerability
- _Impact_: Potential security impact
- _Reproduction_: Steps to reproduce the issue
- _Affected versions_: Which versions are affected
- _Suggested fix_: If you have one
- _Disclosure timeline_: Your preferred disclosure timeline

=== Response Timeline

We aim to:

- _Acknowledge_ receipt within _48 hours_
- _Initial assessment_ within _7 days_
- _Fix development_ within _30 days_ for critical issues
- _Public disclosure_ after fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

=== Vulnerability Severity

We use CVSS 3.1 scoring:

- _Critical_ (9.0-10.0): Immediate attention, emergency patch
- _High_ (7.0-8.9): High priority, patch within 30 days
- _Medium_ (4.0-6.9): Standard priority, patch within 60 days
- _Low_ (0.1-3.9): Low priority, patch in next release

== Security Considerations

=== Tool-Specific Security

This is a _password cracking tool_. Security considerations include:

1. _Hash Algorithm Security_
   - We support multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA256, etc.)
   - Some algorithms (MD5, SHA1) are cryptographically broken
   - Use modern algorithms (SHA256+) for new implementations

2. _Data Protection_
   - _Never commit_ password hashes to version control
   - _Never commit_ cracked passwords to version control
   - Use the `.gitignore` to exclude output directories
   - Clear output files after use

3. _Access Control_
   - Run with minimum required permissions
   - Do not run as root unless absolutely necessary
   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

4. _Network Security_
   - This tool is _offline-first_ by design
   - No network calls in core functionality
   - Web interface should be used on localhost only or behind authentication

=== Known Limitations

1. _Parallel Processing_: Multi-process cracking may consume significant CPU resources
2. _Memory Usage_: Large wordlists may require significant RAM
3. _Output Files_: Generated files may contain sensitive data - secure appropriately

=== Security Best Practices for Users

1. _Authorization_: Always obtain written permission before testing
2. _Data Handling_: Treat all hashes and cracked passwords as sensitive data
3. _Environment_: Use in isolated, controlled environments
4. _Logging_: Disable logging of sensitive data in production
5. _Updates_: Keep the tool updated for security fixes

== Responsible Disclosure

We believe in _coordinated disclosure_:

1. Report vulnerabilities privately
2. Work with us to develop a fix
3. Allow time for users to update
4. Coordinate public disclosure

We will:
- Credit researchers in security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Maintain a security hall of fame for responsible disclosures
- Not pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers

== Security Updates

Security updates are distributed via:

- _GitHub Releases_: Tagged releases with security fixes
- _CHANGELOG.md_: Security fixes documented
- _Security Advisories_: GitHub Security Advisories for critical issues
- _Mailing list_: (if established)

== Scope

=== In Scope

- Vulnerabilities in dicti0nary-attack code
- Security issues in dependencies
- Configuration issues leading to security problems
- Documentation issues that could lead to insecure usage

=== Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Issues in user-specific configurations
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Issues requiring unauthorized access to systems

== Legal Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research. If you:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with systems you have permission to test
- Report issues promptly and cooperate with remediation
- Do not publicly disclose issues before fixes are available

We will not initiate legal action and will work with you on coordinated disclosure.

== Security Hardening

=== For Developers

- All dependencies must be pinned with integrity hashes
- Use automated security scanning (Bandit, Safety)
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Code review for all changes
- No secrets in source code
- Input validation for all user input

=== For Users

- Install from official sources only
- Verify package signatures
- Use virtual environments
- Run with least privilege
- Keep software updated
- Review configuration before use

== Contact

- _Security email_: Create dedicated security@domain when available
- _PGP key_: See `.well-known/security.txt`
- _Security advisories_: GitHub Security tab

== Acknowledgments

We maintain a security hall of fame for responsible disclosures:

_(To be populated as vulnerabilities are responsibly disclosed)_
